        <h2 class="title">Is Censorship Possible in the Technological Age?</h2>
    
        
        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the 20th century, <span class="redacted">during the zenith of totalitarian governments and state censorship,</span> it was easy to control the flow of information. <span class="redacted">Through the censorship of oppositional views and the promotion of propaganda, states were able to create narratives that were virtually unopposed.</span></p>
        
            <p>The most famous example <span class="redacted">of such mass-censorship</span> in this era was the 1933 Nazi book burning, in which people took to the streets to cleanse all <span class="redacted"><i>“un-German”</i></span> literature from public record. Within a number of years the narrative woven by the Nazi elite would unfortunately prove <span class="redacted">Heinrich Heine’s prophetic statement</span> correct,</p> 
        
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“Where they burn books, they will also burn people.”</span></blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Book burning symbolises censorship in the purest of forms and while censorship would manifest itself again in such blatant forms, the motivation behind such campaigns would at least attempt to be concealed.</span> Throughout the Cold War and <span class="redacted">the advancement of technology the power balance between censor and citizen appeared relatively stable, yet</span> with the advent of the technological age a great shift occurred. A shift that hadn’t been felt since the creation of the medieval Gutenberg press.</p>
            
            <div id="cf">
                      <img class="bottom" src="images/book_burning_two.jpg"/>
                      <img class="top" src="images/book_burning.jpg"/>
                    </div>
        
            <p>The internet, much like the Gutenberg press, revolutionized the availability of information for the average person <span class="redacted">and broke the government’s monopoly on information.</span> This new technology allowed instant access to information <span class="redacted">that challenged these narratives and upset the power balance between state and citizen.</span></p>
        
            <p>In 2013, <span class="redacted">Edward Snowden,</span> a former contractor for the CIA, <span class="redacted">leaked thousands of classified documents detailing the illegal mass surveillance of citizens within the United States. It’s been</span> countered that this information was crucial to state security and thus secrecy was essential. <span class="redacted">Whether you view Snowden as a traitor or a freedom fighter is negligible, what is important is despite the labyrinthine apparatus of state censorship all of this information was leaked by a single individual using modern technology.</span></p>
        
            <p>Yet with the dawn of this new information age the government’s <span class="redacted">censorship</span> tools <span class="redacted">were not made obsolete, instead they</span> were repurposed for the 21st century. <span class="redacted">So effectively repurposed that you mightn’t recognise censorship within your own country. Much like the arms race during the Cold War, we currently live in the newest iteration of the arms race between citizen and censor, between freedom and restriction.</span> Governments have kept up to date with the latest <span class="redacted">censorship</span> methods and some old methods linger that harken back to the <span class="redacted">dictatorial</span> days of the 20th century.</p>
        
            <p>In this essay I will be examining how <span class="redacted">censorship has and is being used in authoritarian</span> governments, <span class="redacted">the ways in which people</span> have fought against <span class="redacted">it and answer the question in point, is</span> censorship <span class="redacted">still possible in the technological age?</span></p>


        <h3 id="soviet">The Soviet Union: Behind the Iron Curtain</h3>
            <p>I will use the Soviet Union as an exemplar of <i>“traditional”</i> means <span class="redacted">of censorship</span> which I will later contrast with newer forms.</p>
        
            <p>A few days after the Bolsheviks gained power in 1917 the first media <span class="redacted">censorship</span> laws began. They offered the working class proletariat freedom <span class="redacted">with one hand and took it back with the other.</span> This would be the first of many <span class="redacted">censorship</span> laws that would be passed, <span class="redacted">each one more extreme than the last.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">State censorship was regulated by the <i>Glavlit</i> which was the governmental censorship and state secret protection department.</span> By 1930 all printed material was examined <span class="redacted">and then censored by them</span> before publication. <span class="redacted">Their overzealous tactics were created to strike fear into the populace, Professor of Modern European History, Roger D. Markwick states, they used</span><b><span class="redacted">“a draconian system of censorship coupled with lethal repression.”</span></b>
        
            They expanded their <span class="redacted">censorship</span> laws to all elements of Communist society. Everything from art to music was moulded to fit <span class="redacted">Soviet doctrine restraining</span> artists <span class="redacted">to a select few set of</span> themes.</p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">With the end of World War Two the Soviet Union pursued an isolationist policy and as Churchill stated in his famous speech</span></p> 
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“an iron curtain [had] descended across the continent.”</span></blockquote> 
        
            <p><span class="redacted">This</span> effectively <span class="redacted">blocked outside information from entering the Eastern Bloc</span> allowing the State to be the sole source of information and <span class="redacted">their narrative as paramount to</span> truth. <span class="redacted">Even the past was re-written to fit state propaganda.</span> Markwick postulates this <span class="redacted">revision of history was used to</span>
            
            <b><span class="redacted">“maintain a hegemonic narrative about the past that</span> vindicates the status quo.”</b></p>
            
                    <div id="cf">
                      <img class="bottom" src="images/Stalin%20(altered2).jpg" />
                      <img class="top" src="images/Stalin%20(unaltered).jpg" />
                    </div>
        
            <p>Many <span class="redacted">state opponents, or <i>nonpersons</i>, were sentenced to</span> harsh punishments. <span class="redacted">Such as murdered in <i>the Great Purges</i>, left to die in a Siberian <i>gulag</i> or <i>whitewashed</i></span> from history <span class="redacted">completely. All visual or historical reference to them</span> would be destroyed <span class="redacted">in an effort to falsify history. Author of <i>The Commissar Vanishes</i>, David King writes Stalin whitewashed his political rivals in order to portray himself as</span></p>
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">"successor to Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and founder of the USSR."</span></blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Similarly many citizens rushed to <i>“purge”</i> convicted family members from photographs as a way to avoid drawing suspicion or a similar fate. Much of the populace pursued this <i>“self-censorship”</i> attitude as a means of self-preservation.</span></p>
        
            <p>Despite the threat of violence, the regime <span class="redacted">had its detractors. A grassroots network, <i>Samizdat</i> (self-published),</span> spread hand copied <span class="redacted">banned</span> material throughout the Eastern Bloc. <span class="redacted">Soviet Dissenter,</span> Vladimir Bukovskij describes the reality of being a member <span class="redacted">of the <i>Samizdat</i>,</span>
        
            <b>"I myself create it, edit it, censor it, publish it, distribute it, <span class="redacted">and [may] get imprisoned for it."</span></b>
        
            <span class="redacted">Due to the State owning all printing presses each book had to be hand copied.</span></p>
        
            <p>Natalya Gorbanevskaya was founder of the most famous <span class="redacted"><i>Samizdat</i></span> periodical, <i>A Chronicle of Current Events</i>. Author and media expert Peter Kirwan writes,</p>  
        
            <blockquote>“…Gorbanebskaya would tap out six identical copies of <i>Chronicle</i> on a <span class="redacted">contraband</span> typewriter. Next, she distributed these editions to six friends, who would, in turn, type out further copies before distributing them to additional readers.”</blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Dissemination of this information was dangerous and much care had to be taken to avoid detection. According to writer Benjamin Ramm, Exiled Soviet poet Osip Mandelstam had his poems</span> <b><span class="redacted">“sewn into the insides of cushions and shoes, or hidden in mattresses and saucepans.”</span></b></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">It is also through such clandestine methods that banned materials could pass through the Iron Curtain.</span> A similar practice <span class="redacted">called <i>Tamizdat</i> (published over there)</span> would use more modern approaches such as rock and roll music or political tracts <span class="redacted">smuggled in</span> on bootleg records made from x-ray film. <span class="redacted">In the Socialist Republic of Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu,</span> many western films <span class="redacted">were smuggled into the Eastern Bloc and within a day of the tapes</span> entering Romania <span class="redacted">they</span> were translated, copied and distributed. The <span class="redacted">bootlegged</span> videos were immensely popular <span class="redacted">and a huge black market formed.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">In the documentary <i>Chuck Norris vs. Communism</i>, a subject described watching these bootlegged videos as</span>
            <b><span class="redacted">“a realization of how far behind the West and how culturally isolated their Eastern European nation had become.”</span></b>The man behind this <span class="redacted">bootlegging</span> operation, Teodor Zamfir, <span class="redacted">states in the same documentary,</span></p> 
        
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“During a dictatorship which</span> had controlled everything, <span class="redacted">they lost control of something that seemed insignificant, the videotape. The videotapes set the whole communist system off balance."</span></blockquote>
        
            <p>Other outside influences such as <i>Radio Free Europe</i> <span class="redacted">also penetrated the Iron Curtain and</span> worked to <span class="redacted">undermine and challenge the Soviet narrative.  This lead to the government trying to</span> jam radio signals. Lithuanian radio journalist, Rimantas Pleikis, stated in a Russia Beyond article</p>
        
            <blockquote>“the USSR possessed the most powerful and wide scale <span class="redacted">“anti-</span>radio” system in the world.”</blockquote> 
        
            <p>This jamming campaign was viewed more as a nuisance <span class="redacted">and paradoxically made these foreign narratives even more popular.</span> Citizens bypassed these censorship methods in creative manners.        
            Kritika Mikkonen states in his essay <i>Stealing the Monopoly of Knowledge</i>, some methods involved</p>
            
            <blockquote>“…readjusting [radio] sets with bits collected here….there were cases where even junior school children started to build their own sets in order to listen to <span class="redacted">Western</span> broadcasts.”</blockquote>
        
            <p>By the late 1980s over 60 foreign radio stations were broadcasting into the Eastern Bloc <span class="redacted">which forced the futile jamming efforts to cease entirely.</span></p>

                    </div>
            
            <p>During the later years of the Soviet Union, political reforms such as <i>glasnost</i> (openness) and <i>perestroika</i> (restructuring) allowed more freedom of expression <span class="redacted">and exposed much of the tension harboured after years of repression.</span> With this new openness, the Soviet population noticed the abundance of products available <span class="redacted">in capitalist societies (particularly America) compared to the relative scarcity</span> in the Eastern Bloc. <span class="redacted">This clash of realities often dubbed <i>the war between the refrigerator and the television</i>, or peoples living conditions vs state propaganda, was a serious issue for the State. It severely undermined the propaganda of the time and cracks in the state narrative became obvious.</span></p>
        
            <p>On November 9, 1989 <span class="redacted">the Berlin Wall fell, the Iron curtain was drawn and</span> a period of rapid change galvanized the many nations and its peoples to action. Many Soviet writers reflected on the past years <span class="redacted">of repression that followed, succinctly called <i>Omni-censorship</i> (ВСЕЦЕНЗУРА) by Russian scholar Marianna Tax Choldin.</span> Bibliographer for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies, June Pachuta Farris, states the realities <span class="redacted">of living under the Soviet yoke, censorship was</span></p>
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“…all-pervasive, and woven through the entire fabric</span> of Soviet society. All citizens…knew <span class="redacted">not only what they MUST NOT do, but also</span> what they MUST do in order to get ahead <span class="redacted">or in the worst of times, just to survive. If unexpressed thoughts could have been censored, they would have been…”</span></blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">The Soviet model of censorship used <i>“traditional”</i> blunt tools, censorship was obvious and punishments were often brutal. The government</span> <span class="redacted">struggled with competing narratives and factions, from within and without, which ultimately lead to its dissolution. Even though they forced the populace into a terminal state of self-censorship they ultimately lost when the illusions they painted simply couldn’t compete with reality.</span></p>



        <h3 id="china">China: The Great Firewall of China</h3>
        
            <p>Unlike the Soviets, China’s <span class="redacted">censorship</span> tools became more covert as they evolved. <span class="redacted">While the censorship methods were just as brutal to the Soviet Union’s during the time of China’s <i>Cultural Revolution</i></span> they changed with technological progress.</p>
        
            <p>China possesses the largest <span class="redacted">censorship and surveillance</span> program in the world. With an estimated 2 million <span class="redacted">online censors</span> being employed in China, according to a study in 2013 by the BBC. The People’s Republic of China also has the <span class="redacted">dubious</span> honour of having</p>
            
            <blockquote>"the largest recorded number of <span class="redacted">imprisoned</span> journalists <span class="redacted">and cyber-dissidents</span> in the world,"</blockquote>
            
            <p>according to the <i>Ashgate Research Companion to Chinese Foreign Policy."</i></p>
 
            <p><span class="redacted">According to Senior Fellow of Asian Studies, Gudrun Wacker, The PRC will</span> censor any information that,
        
            <b>“[...] endangers national security, discloses state secrets, subverts the government, destroys the unity of the country. [...] Damages the honour and the interests of the State. [...] disturbs social order, under -mines social stability [...]”</b></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">While</span> this statute <span class="redacted">seems reasonable the language used is deliberately undefined allowing a wider form of censorship and persecution where needed. The ability for the government to manipulate such laws </span>enforces a stricter personal and corporate <span class="redacted">self-censorship</span> attitude. <span class="redacted">The responsibility of enforcing these laws on the behalf of the government sometimes falls on international or private companies and so they are overzealous in their censorship enforcement</span> in order to avoid financial punishments or criminal proceedings.</p>

                    </div>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">The famed <i>Great Firewall of China</i> is the jewel in the crown of the countries censorship apparatus. In simple terms it controls</span> the flow of information in and out of China. <span class="redacted">It does this through a number of known technical methods such as banning websites than possess certain sensitive keywords, corrupting web addresses, thus making the site inaccessible and appointing human censors to manually analyse information. This state apparatus</span> is constantly being improved with hopes of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) being implemented in the future.</p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">The banning of sites often seems to happen randomly, almost as a method of confusing <i>netizens.</i></span> The purpose of this <span class="redacted">censorship</span> methodology is not to ban all external information, but to filter what passes through the membrane of the countries internet borders. <span class="redacted">This form of <i>“porous censorship”</i>, as Roberts puts it, partially filters out external narratives as it</span></p>
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“allows the government to avoid widespread use of observable repression.”</span></blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">This methodology is further used when censoring internal subversive materials.</span> Often websites that post scathing reviews about the government are not likely to be censored. <span class="redacted">However websites focusing on Tibetan Independence, political reforms or Party corruption certainly will.</span> This is reinforced by a Harvard study by King who postulates, China’s <span class="redacted">censorship</span> program</p>
        
            <blockquote>“is not to suppress criticism of the state” <span class="redacted">but to “reduce the probability of collective action by clipping social ties whenever any collective movements are in evidence."</span></blockquote>
        
            <p>On rare occasions <span class="redacted">when</span> a journalist or cyber dissident posts a story that <span class="redacted">the Party deem unacceptable there is often a high level public trial. This</span> has a chilling effect on public discourse and acts as a deterrent for <i>netizens</i> activities. This methodology is sometimes dubbed <i>Kill the chicken to scare the monkeys</i> in China. <span class="redacted">It is through this strategy of constant surveillance, optional self-censorship and rare but harsh punishments that makes porous censorship so effective.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Self-censorship, ironically, is the most effective of all of China’s censorship tools. Their censorship program has been labelled a</span></p>
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“<i>panopticon</i> that encourages self-censorship through the perception that users are being watched, rather than a true firewall” according to a study by UC Davis.</span></blockquote>
        
            <p>According to the Oxford Dictionary, a <span class="redacted"><i>panopticon</i> is a</span>
            
            <b><span class="redacted">“circular prison with cells arranged around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be observed.”</span></b></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">However in</span> social theory <span class="redacted"><i>panopticonism</i></span> is a way to control the behaviour of people through the <i>“perception”</i> of constant surveillance and palpable presence of power. <span class="redacted">Even though constant surveillance and demonstration of power is not possible as long the illusion persists, the prisoner will act accordingly.</span></p>
        
            <div id="cf">
                      <img class="bottom" src="images/panopticon%20(altered).jpg"/>
                      <img class="top" src="images/panopticon%20(unaltered).jpg"/>
                    </div>
            
            <p>Due to this constant threat, the PRC effectively controls <span class="redacted">the actions of its citizens. This form of self-censorship extends further into social scenarios in real life, whether talking in a public forum or</span> discussing sensitive subjects. In the documentary <i>China on China</i>, writer, Yan Lianke, says</p>
            
            <blockquote>“China's censorship is not as rigorous as everyone thinks. <span class="redacted">The self-censorship of the authors is much worse.”</span></blockquote>
        
            <p>Despite this, it is possible for <i>netizens</i> to circumvent these <span class="redacted">censorship methods. Technical methods include using proxy servers or VPNs to access banned</span> websites. In response to their use many VPNs have been compromised and rumours of proxy servers being used as <i>“honey traps”</i> by the government <span class="redacted">to gather details of users have curtailed their use somewhat.</span> There is no official proof of these <i>honey traps</i> <span class="redacted">however it fits in with the <i>panopticon</i> concept of an imagined threat.</span></p>
        
            <p>Other technical methods of evasion include encryption of messages, peer-to-peer software or changing IP addresses <span class="redacted">in case the government has blocked a user. Every time a new method of avoiding censorship appears, the government has a counter-measure to negate it. Here we see the technological arms race between censor and citizen play out in real time.</span></p>
        
            <p>Many <i>netizens</i> have found creative ways of bypassing <span class="redacted"><i>the Great Firewall</i> through the use of linguistic methods and satire. This allows the user to discuss</span> off limit topics <span class="redacted">without fear of censorship or punishment.</span></p> 
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Perhaps the most famous example is referring to internet censors as <i>“river crabs”</i> (河蟹). River crab is a close homophone of <i>“harmony”</i> (和諧), which in this case is a joke referring, to former president Hu Jintao’s concept of a <i>“Harmonious Society”</i>.  This term, <i>"Harmonious Society"</i>, has emerged as a byword for suppression, censorship or <i>"stability at all costs"</i>. Thus when a <i>netizens</i> website has been censored, they</span> <span class="redacted"> can say their work has been <i>"harmonized"</i> (被和谐了). Over time <i>"harmonized"</i> changed into <i>“river-crabbed”</i> as government censors were learning of its euphemistic usage. We see once again evidence of a censorship arms-race, with each side trying to outpace the other.</span></p>
        
        <p>Author of <i>The Chinese Language as a Weapon</i>, Jeanette Si writes</p>
            
        <blockquote>“On today’s Chinese Internet, fully comprehending the language requires a thorough knowledge of current events, a deep respect for historical implications, an agile mastery of cultural conventions, and more often than not, a healthy appreciation of topical humor.”</blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Although these methods are detected by human censors, these words are so commonly used that</span> censoring would be catastrophic for China’s internet services. This highlights the reality of <i>pan-censorship</i> in the technological age. Former State Internet Information Director, Lu Wei states <span class="redacted">in Margaret Robert’s book, <i>Censored</i>,</span></p>
            
        <blockquote>“It is not possible to apply censorship to this enormous amount of data. But no censorship does not mean no management.”</blockquote>
        
            <p>This is the best way of looking at censorship in China; the State simply tries to manage the flow of information <span class="redacted">as it’s ultimately futile to censor all subversive narratives.</span></p>
        
            <p>China is the embodiment of <span class="redacted">censorship in</span> the 21st century, <span class="redacted">while they lack the brutalism of the Soviet system they make up for it</span> through technical proficiency and stealthy methodologies. <span class="redacted">Visible widespread</span> repression is reduced <span class="redacted">and the tools of censorship are sharpened to cut social ties and collective action. Through pervasive surveillance they have birthed a culture of self-censorship. Yet this entire technical system can be defied through the all too human custom of linguistic humour and satire.</span></p>



        <h3 id="korea">North Korea: The Hermit Kingdom</h3>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Censorship in</span> the Hermit Kingdom is a blend of old Soviet and new Sino methods that have been magnified <span class="redacted">into sheer totalitarianism. Everything within North Korea is geared towards isolationism and censorship. Due to this it continues to place last in the World Press Freedom Index, with Reporters without Borders adding</span>
        
            <b><span class="redacted">“its totalitarian regime keeps its citizens in a state of ignorance.”</span></b></p>
        
            <p>Ever since the creation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 1948, its ruler and founder Kim Il-sung ruled through <span class="redacted">suppression, fear and ruthless punishment. There was a wide campaign of censorship and propaganda, deifying Kim Il-sung and</span> spreading his unique form of <i>Juche</i> (self-reliance) Communism. This <span class="redacted">form of strict censorship, limiting of basic human rights and isolationist</span> policy has continued to this very day.</p>
        
            <p>The North Korean State has <span class="redacted">authoritarian</span> control of all forms of media and communication within its borders. <span class="redacted">Due to this monopoly they can control the narrative of all outside events and change public opinion to suit the Party’s interests.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Despite the North Korean constitution</span> guaranteeing freedom of speech <i>(Article 67)</i> <span class="redacted">any reporting that</span> is <span class="redacted">not</span> sanctioned by the government <span class="redacted">is illegal and punishable.</span> Reporters are re-educated <span class="redacted">in Party doctrine</span> weekly <span class="redacted">and are closer to political activists.</span> Vincent Brossel <span class="redacted">from Reporters without Borders</span> states in his fact-finding report,
        
        <b>“There are four categories of reporting. The priority is publicising the greatness of Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il. Second place goes to demonstrating the superiority of North Korean socialism. Third is denouncing imperialist and bourgeois corruption."</b></p>
        
            <p>Any form of State criticism is considered <span class="redacted">treason however even</span> minor <span class="redacted">infractions carry a heavy sentence. Vincent Brossel interviewed an anonymous North Korean escapee who stated,</span></p>
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“I was punished for six months,</span> <span class="redacted">forced to work on a pig farm, for forgetting to write the last syllable of Kim Jong-il.”</span></blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Self-censorship extends down to the North Korean populace, more as form of self-preservation. In 2016, according to <i>Radio Free Asia</i>,</span> <b><span class="redacted">“Kim Jong-un banned sarcasm because he fears people only agree with him ironically.”</span></b>      
            <span class="redacted">Such phrases as</span> <b>“this is all America’s fault”</b> <span class="redacted">and reference to him being</span> <b><span class="redacted">“a fool who cannot see the outside world”</span></b> <span class="redacted">carry the ominous threat that the offender will</span> <b><span class="redacted">“not be forgiven.”</span></b></p>
        
            <p>Public criticism of the State is dangerous <span class="redacted">due to the vast network of undercover informants within the country. There primary role is to monitor and</span> report on any individuals that don’t comply with Party protocol or possess any foreign material. <span class="redacted">Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute says,</span></p>

            <blockquote><span class="redacted">"It's as close to a Big Brother society</span> as a society <span class="redacted">populated by human beings can possibly be. There are multiple competing secret police who spy on the</span> people <span class="redacted">and on each other. So, no one</span> can relax and have a private life."</blockquote>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">This mass surveillance has been furthered by the installation of microphones into outdoor areas and extensive wiretapping of phones.</span> So North Korean citizens are <span class="redacted">not</span> truly free in the real world, well what about the bastion of freedom that is the internet?</p>
        
            <p><i>Kwangmyong</i>, the <span class="redacted">most tightly controlled and monitored</span> state intranet <span class="redacted">in the world,</span> possesses <span class="redacted">a mere 1000-5000 sites with only high ranking officials having limited</span> access to the world internet through a single fibre optic line in and out of the country. <span class="redacted">All computers are registered with the government, systematically checked and heavily monitored. The financial cost of owning a computer equates to <b>“as much as three months average salary”</b></span> <span class="redacted">for a normal citizen, according to a Telegraph report by Mike Wright. Thus the far reaching liberating effects of the internet are stifled completely. North Korea has been described, by Julien Pain of Reporters without Borders, as</span>
            
            <b><span class="redacted">“the world’s worst Internet black hole”</span></b>
        
            <span class="redacted">and it appears to be by design.</span></p>
        
            <p>Professor of International Law at Harvard, Jonathan Zittrain, states in a NY Times interview that <span class="redacted">access to the internet would conflict with its<b> “comprehensive official fantasy worldview”</b> and</span><b> “any information leakage <span class="redacted">from the outside world</span> could be devastating”.</b></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Another reason for this impenetrable barrier is to make it</span></p>
        
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“extremely difficult for people in North Korea to tell the outside world about systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations...”</span></blockquote> <p><span class="redacted">according to a fact-finding report from Amnesty international called <i>Connection Denied.</i></span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Despite the isolationism of North Korea,</span> television and radio waves still manage to penetrate its borders. The radio sets sold in North Korea are pre-set to government frequencies and are sealed to prevent any form of tampering. <span class="redacted">There are Party operatives, named the <i>inminban</i>, within each province that regularly check televisions and radios for any form of tampering or illegal usage.</span> Despite this it is possible to obtain <span class="redacted">black market</span> radios that allow citizens to listen to external radio media. <span class="redacted">Much like the Soviets, the DPRK attempt to jam these radio and television signals however they are usually ineffective due to routine power cuts.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Usually threats of excessive violence are enough to deter</span> the majority of the populace. <span class="redacted">Yet some brave citizens</span> have <span class="redacted">risked punishment to smuggle in</span> mobile phones, DVDs, USBs or foreign material. Just like in <span class="redacted">Socialist</span> Romania, there is a vast want for foreign media from everyday citizenry and higher party officials. According to a report called <i>A Quiet Opening</i>, by Nat Kretchun and Jane Kim,</p> 
            
        <blockquote>“one third of television viewers [are] claiming to have viewed foreign content.”</blockquote> 
        
        <p>In the same report an anonymous North Korean female said
        
        <b>“almost all citizens listen or watch. You can tell when you talk to them…they will use [South] Korean words… you think, “that person watches too.””</b></p>
        
            <p>The cultural impact of foreign media is starting to manifest in different ways. Higher party officials are buying more imported western goods, <span class="redacted">western clothes and styling their hair in ways not preordained by the government.</span></p>
            
            <div id="cf">
                      <img class="bottom" src="images/north-korea-two%20(unaltered).jpg"/>

                    </div>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">Perhaps the most effective method of escaping censorship in North Korea is the use of</span> mobile phones. <span class="redacted">Despite them being introduced and then banned by the government, they</span> are more popular than ever. They were originally used by traders in order to source food from China in the nineties <span class="redacted">during the worst times of the countries famine.</span></p>
        
            <p>Other than allowing foreign information into the country they also allow the populace to spread information <span class="redacted">about the <i>Hermit Kingdom</i></span> to the outside world. <span class="redacted">Some brave individuals contact outside journalists, particularly in South Korea, and provide them with images or messages about the conditions within the country.</span> Some even act as self-publishing journalists by spreading <span class="redacted">subversive</span> information to other citizens within North Korea.</p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">The consequence of contacting any South Korean is the infamous <i>three generations of punishment</i>, in which not only is the person punished, but so is their family. Then the next two generations of the</span> <span class="redacted">family born in these labour camps are also sentenced. According to a Telegraph article by Mike Wright,</span></p>
            
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">“Survivors have described prisoners becoming stunted and deformed from carrying out hard labour for 12 hours a day, seven days a week.”</span></blockquote> 
        
            <p><span class="redacted">And yet people still defy the State in the pursuit of truth.</span></p>
        
            <p><span class="redacted">North Korea’s form of isolationism and censorship borders on the absurd.</span> The State <span class="redacted">segregates itself from the outside world entirely, leaving</span> <span class="redacted">the populace in a state of ignorance and at the whims of a self-proclaimed quasi-deity. Surveillance</span> is perpetual and <span class="redacted">true freedom of expression is non-existent. Traditional dictatorial repression and brutal punishment serve as deterrents, yet a large minority still risk their lives</span> in pursuit of freedom and truth <span class="redacted">despite the consequences.</span></p>



        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        
            <p>Many states have had to change their <span class="redacted">censorship</span> practices with the dawn of the technological age. Soviet Russia relied on <i>“traditional”</i> <span class="redacted">terror, punishment and propaganda to enforce its political </span>ideology <span class="redacted">which ultimately failed.</span> China <i>“sells”</i> <span class="redacted">censorship in a market they control and bans efforts at</span> group collectivism, <span class="redacted">birthing a culture of self-censorship.</span>  North Korea uses a combination of traditional and modern <span class="redacted">censorship</span> methods combined <span class="redacted">with sheer isolationism and brutal repression.</span></p>
        
            <p>They all try to create <span class="redacted">this thin veneer of</span> freedom and impartiality <span class="redacted">yet under the surface the mechanisms of censorship are at work.</span> I would argue that the <span class="redacted">old authoritarian and dictatorial spirit is still within these governments actions and yet they must hide these from the populace for fear of the repercussions. Some of the governments examined use</span> moral <span class="redacted">arguments to justify their actions; others use</span> economic or nationalistic reasons. <span class="redacted">Yet they all have political motivations to</span> justify the status quo within each state.</p>
        
            <p>Despite these states’ <span class="redacted">crafted narratives and</span> various <span class="redacted">censorship</span> methods, the ceaseless flow of information is unstoppable. <span class="redacted">The illusions that are painted by these narratives never stand the test of time; sooner or later reality always comes crashing in.</span> The perfect <i>panopticon</i> is still nothing but a philosophical concept with no true physical embodiment. <span class="redacted">Yet with the ever increasing reach of technology I can’t help but feel we are edging towards this as a possibility.</span></p>
        
            <p>Technology might be the antidote <span class="redacted">and the poison depending on who wields this powerful tool.</span> As Professor Philip Bennett states in Columbia Journalism Review article,</p>
            
            <blockquote>“Technological innovation will…enable individuals and organizations to counteract <span class="redacted">government</span> censorship, <span class="redacted">even as governments adopt technologies that enhance their ability to censor.”</span></blockquote> 
        
            <p><span class="redacted">It is a constant arms race between two forces.  I would argue that technology is merely the tool,</span> the true battle between censorship and freedom is between the will of the people versus the <span class="redacted">governments will to control.</span></p>
        
            <blockquote><span class="redacted">Yes censorship is possible in the technological age, for a time, but it waxes and wanes with the constant power struggle between</span> citizen <span class="redacted">and censor.</span></blockquote>
